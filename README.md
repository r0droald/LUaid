# LUaid.org - LU Disaster and Relief Operations
A Progressive Web App for LU Disaster and Relief Operations. This is an open-source project built to track and visualize donations, volunteer deployments, and aid distribution in the wake of Typhoon Emong in La Union, Philippines. Functionality covers field operability, editorial flow, and real-time transparency. It is designed to be resilient, modular, high impact and accessible even in low-connectivity zones. We publish this software in the hopes of being useful for disaster relief operations in your location.
